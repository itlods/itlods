- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @itlods aka Kurt Mielke
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in modern c++

I publish small projects, developed to be parts of bigger projects, thinking other developers might find some of these small projects usefull. "Small is beautiful"

About IT-lods. In Danish "lods" is the kind of pilot, taken aboard a ship. Knowing difficult waters and therefore guiding the ship through those. As I work as an IT consultant, often taken aboard IT projects, I think the name quite well describes my trade.
Though, this is mostly in an ideal world. In reality the ship already was run aground and bad weather set in, long before I was invited - perhaps this is familiar to you too?

"Lods" originatess from the Northern German Dialect: lots/lotsman and further back from Old English: Loadsman.
